# Alien Infiltrator

The aliens have to find the imposter who wants to save the world!

An Among us-like game developed as part of the [Ctrl-s Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ctrls-game-jam) in Luleå in November 2022.

The game is partly functional (players can join a multiplayer LAN game, walk around the map and see each other) but not complete as most gameplay elements are either not synced over the network (e.g. completing tasks, assigning a random imposter, losing/winning) or not implemented.
